HOS-ocean
=========
High-Order Spectral method for oceanic simulations


This readme file describes the different cases that might be computed with the periodic HOS model
and gives instructions to set the numerical parameters n1 to p2

Setting the value of integers n1, n2, M, p1 and p2 in variables_3D.f90

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
For a 2D simulation, 
	Compile with n2=1 AND p2=1 to adjust the memory allocation to minimum
	
	If partial dealiasing is used, compile with p1 set to maximal required value 
   (total dealiasing is obtained with p1=M 
   but it can be reduced if p1 is further set to a value below M)

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
For a 3D simulation, 
   Compile with n2\=1 AND p2 set to required value
	
   If partial dealiasing is used in x-direction, 
   compile with p1 set to maximal required value (total dealiasing is obtained with p1=M
   but it can be reduced if p1 is further set to a value below M)
	
   If partial dealiasing is used in y-direction, 
   compile with p2 set to maximal required value (total dealiasing is obtained with p2=M
   but it can be reduced if p2 is further set to a value below M)

###### 'input_HOS.dat' will have to be attached to run this program ######

Setting the value of integer i_case in 'input_HOS.dat'

i_case = 1 : starts from rest
	
i_case = 2 and 21 : starts with a natural mode
   2  - progressive wave: potential on free surface accrodingly to linear theory
   21 - stationary wave: no velocity at initial time
   The number of the mode, its amplitude and phase have to be chosen 
   in the module 'initial_condition.f90'.
	
i_case = 3 and 31 and 32 : Irregular directional sea-state from spectrum specified :
      3  - input file parameters
      31 - WAVEWATCH IIIÂ® spectrum file
      32 - previous HOS-ocean simulation
		
i_case = 8... : Nonlinear regular wave (from Rienecker and Fenton)
	this means that xlen and ylen are interpreted as integer and represent the number of wavelength 
	in x- and y- direction respectively
	i_case = 81
		steepness 0.1
	i_case = 82
		steepness 0.2
	i_case = 83
		steepness 0.3
	i_case = 84
		steepness 0.4
	i_case = 89
		steepness 0.09
